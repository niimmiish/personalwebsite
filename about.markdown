I am Nimish Sheth -- a data gaucho by profession and a outdoors biped otherwise. I live in Northern Virginia. In college, I wanted to be a professional photographer, but became an accidental Math undergraduate and then went on to get a Master's in <font color=brick>Industrial Engineering</font> from <font color=brick>Virginia Tech</font>. During the course of my dissertation, I became intrigued with the wonderous world of using data to model the real world and organize it to understand and see it better.

Fast forward some years...I have worked in all aspects of <font color=brick>data solutions</font> -- as an analyst, data miner, data integration engineer, product requirements analyst, implementation engineer, and more. My exprience ranges across public and private companies -- in financial crime detection, compliance risk,  defense logistics, and a few other areas. 

Currently, I am an <font color=brick>independent consultant</font>, often working with financial services firms to help develop and validate compliance and regulatory models used for financial crime monitoring and prevention.
